# Note-Keeper
A React application for personal note-keeping with features like creating and deleting notes - implemented with concepts like ES6, JSX, and React hooks to manage state and lifecycle effectively. I utilized destructuring and the spread operator for cleaner, more readable code. Working with components and the Virtual DOM allowed me to optimize rendering performance, while the component tree and props helped ensure efficient data flow and modularity throughout the app. 

This project was created using Code Sandbox and can be accessed [here](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/notes-keeper-mr5r6m).
